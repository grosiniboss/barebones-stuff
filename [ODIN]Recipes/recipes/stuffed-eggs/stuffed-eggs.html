<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Filled eggs, also known as deviled eggs, are a popular appetizer made by halving hard-boiled eggs and filling them with a seasoned mixture of their own yolks.</p>
<br>
<h2>Recipe</h2>

<ul class="recipe">
  <li>10 eggs</li>
  <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol class="steps">
  <li>Place eggs in a large pot and cover with cool water. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Transfer eggs to a bowl of cold water using tongs. Peel.</li>
  <li>Cut eggs in half. Slice a small piece off bottoms so halves don't tip over. Place yolks in a mixing bowl. Add mayonnaise, mustard, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Mix until creamy, 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Spoon yolk mixture into egg white halves. Garnish with a dot of ketchup on top. Refrigerate about 20 minutes before serving.</li>
